## What this is:
Back-end for a face recognition app using the [Clarifai AI](https://www.clarifai.com/). This back-end is using a Postgres database, Node to run the server, and a simple API schema to make calls to Clarifai, and access data from the database, and send/receive information to the front-end.

## Dependencies:
1. react
2. express
3. knex
4. bcrypt
5. postgres

## To run locally,
This back-end will not work locally, there is no API key necessary to access teh Clarifai API stored.

To see the app go to: [Heroku Deployment](https://facerecognitionfrontend.herokuapp.com/)
